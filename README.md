Those who earn the Google Cybersecurity Certificate have completed eight courses, developed by Google, that include hands-on, practice-based assessments and are designed to prepare them for roles in cybersecurity. They are competent in Python, Linux, SQL, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). They know how to identify common cybersecurity risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as the techniques to mitigate.

***The focus of this Portfolio was to gather, improve and complete activies related to Cyber Security and presented in Google's Professional Cyber Security Specialization.*** 


This course covered many conceptual topics such as:
  * Risk management
  * Threat analysis
  * Network security
  * Incident response

It also taught me technical skills with:
  * SIEM tools (Splunk)
  * Network protocol analyzers (Wireshark and tcpdump)
  * IDS/IPS tools
  * Firewalls

And I was able to develop even further in the following skills:
<li>Python</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Linux</li>
